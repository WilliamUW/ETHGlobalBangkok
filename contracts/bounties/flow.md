Feedback for Flow:

- Super straightforward to deploy and interact with!
- I love how the testnet faucet provides 1000 FLOW to play around with. I never feel like I am constrained by the testnet token quantity unlike with other chains.
- I love how FLOW EVM testnet is directly integrated with Dynamic wallet, so I can super easily import the chain and begin interacting with my deployed Flow smart contracts using viem and wagmi.
- The gas fees are super low and the transaction timing is lightning fast. I love the responsiveness!
